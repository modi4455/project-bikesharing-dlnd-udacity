# project-bikesharing-dlnd-udacity
Developed as coursework for Udacity "Deep Learning Fundamentals" Nanodegree. In this project, I built a neural network to predict daily bike rental ridership.
## Further Explanation
The Neural network was built from "scratch", using only NumPy to assist. The goal of this project is to understand what happens behind the neural network before diving deeper into other tools like TensorFlow.
